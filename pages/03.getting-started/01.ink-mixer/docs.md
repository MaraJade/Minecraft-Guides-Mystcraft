The Ink Mixer allows you to create Linking Panel Pages. You need to supply it with ink vials and paper. This creates a normal Linking Panel Page. You can add other items to the ink in the Ink Mixer for different effects on the book the Linking Panel Pages are used to create.

By default, the ink circle in the middle of the UI is black. You can add materials (Ender Pearls, Bottles of Experience, Clay, etc.) to the circle. Adding these will cause the circle to flash, depending on what you add into the circle. When the circle flashes, it means that any book created with this page has a chance of having a special effect.

Effect descriptions:


* **Generate Platform**: Regardless of what happens to the world, this book will always generate a 1x1x1 platform under the spawn location.
* **Disarm**: This book will prevent ALL inventory items from being linked. They will be dropped at the origin and leave the user (cart chest, mob, etc.) with an empty inventory on the other end.
* **Intra-Linking**: This book will allow links made from the same Age/Dimension.
* **Maintain Momentum**: “Now you're thinking with portals.” When entering a new Dimension, your current momentum (if any) will be maintained.
