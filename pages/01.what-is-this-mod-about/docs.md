Mystcraft is a popular mod based on the Myst series. Made popular in Minecraft 1.7.10, Mystcraft allows you to write books to travel to “Ages” or Dimensions with a variety of different parameters. Lava Lakes? Easy. Permanent night? No problem. Diamond Block spheres? 

Possible, but not recommended

Mystcraft lets you take control, and as long as your Ages are stable, you can create any type of dimension and customize how it looks and what features it has. The only thing that can truly kill you in Mystcraft are Greed and Impatience which lead to unstable, potentially deadly Ages.
